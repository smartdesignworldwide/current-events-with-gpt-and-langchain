    "With all the hype around ChatGPT, we wanted to explore what it's like to develop using OpenAI's APIs. What would it be like to train a model using GPT-3 as a platform? How much training data would it take? How much would it cost? What would we learn and how hard would it be?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to learn more, we needed to pick a niche that GPT-3 didn't know about. We chose current events. The latest version of GPT-3 (often referred to as GPT-3.5) is trained on data thru June 2021. Anything after this, the model doesn't know about. By downloading RSS feeds of popular news sites, we could teach GPT-3 about things it didn't know. We could then test it out by asking the new model questions about events that happened after June 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI offers a service called fine tuning which allows you to customize a model by feeding it prompts and responses which would be examples of what it should learn. This was our first approach to solving this problem."

    "Imagine if we searched for the content of our prompt within our recent news data and only populated the content that was appropriate. A typical full text search index wouldn't be appropriate here because it's very unlikely the exact words will appear in our content, especially since our content is full of statements and our prompt is a question. Instead we'll use some cutting edge technology that can determine text that's similar to other text. OpenAI recently released a Text Embeddings API which allows one to convert words into a vector that can be compared to other vectors. The vector equivalent of the statement \"people work\" would be similar to the vector equivalent of \"humans do jobs\" even though the words are completely different. If we only populate our prompt with language that's similar to our prompt we're likely to have the answer in the prompt. FAISS is a Vector Store we can use to compare text embeddings and langchain supports it as a way to build prompts for OpenAI. We'll build a search index and then only populate our prompt with information that's similar to our prompt.\n",

    "While this is a powerful utilization of some cutting edge Natural Language Processing, there are still a few potential shortcomings of this approach. One issue is authority. FAISS only cares about how similar text is for populating prompts. If I wanted to ask the model \"What color is the dog?\" and within my text database I see \"The dog is black\" and \"The dog is white,\" the vector index has no way of knowing which to present to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue is that if there are many pieces of text that are similar to the prompt it will result in a very large prompt which will increase processing time and cost. \n",

    "All the same, we're at the beginning of a very interesting time where we seem to be reaching a critical velocity with generative AI. Tools like Langchain which have the power to accelerate already powerful tools are the sign of even more intersting times to come. With GPT-4 likely to be released any time, this year should prove to be another year of growth for AI."
